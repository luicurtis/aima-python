The knowledge base I have created is for basic animal identificaion.
Each animal is of different type with specific characteristics that make them identifiable.
Using this information, we can simply create definite clauses that could potentially identify 
differnt kinds of that animal.

The rules were created based on first being able to identify the type of animal. With more information,
one would be able to identify the specific type of animal given more specific details that are unique to 
them. 

Example)
If you see an animal that looks like a bear but you dont know the type:
    kb> tell large_bodies stocky_legs long_snout claws four_legged white long_neck
    kb> infer_all

This would result in infering a polar bear.
